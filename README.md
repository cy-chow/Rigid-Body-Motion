# Rigid Body Motion

## Intermediate Axis Theorem

We simulate the intermediate axis theorem (also known as the tennis racket theorem or Dzhanibekov effect) using OpenGL.

For a detailed explanation behind the code and physics, view the corresponding
[website](https://cy-chow.github.io/Rigid-Body-Motion/).

## Usage

To run the program from the repo,
```
cd code

make

./SceneViewer
```

By default the program prints a guide with controls to the terminal.
